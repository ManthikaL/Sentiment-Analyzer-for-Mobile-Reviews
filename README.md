# Sentiment-Analyzer-for-Mobile-Reviews
This project builds a Flask-based web application that processes mobile phone reviews, using machine learning to predict sentiment labels (positive/negative). It cleans, tokenizes, and lemmatizes reviews, then classifies them via a pre-trained model, displaying ratings for various mobile products based on customer feedback.
